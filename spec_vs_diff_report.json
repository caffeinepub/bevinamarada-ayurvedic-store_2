  "summary": "The diff implements reverts for all four required files (AdminDashboardPage.tsx, AdminSidebar.tsx, AdminProductsPage.tsx, index.css, tailwind.config.js). All four REQs appear addressed: sidebar nav items match pre-V2 (Dashboard, Products, Sales & Income, Enquiries, Logout only), dark mode removed from CSS/Tailwind, Ayurvedic palette restored, dashboard summary cards and low-stock section present, and product page restored with card layout and action buttons. Minor concern: the AdminDashboardPage.tsx is truncated so full verification of all summary cards and low-stock section is limited, but the file summary confirms intent. No hallucinated features detected beyond what was requested.",
